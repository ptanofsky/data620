Conclusion:
Appears to be two islands of women within the full list
And using the weights of the projected graph, we see the boundary spanners are Therea A, Ruth D on one side and Nora F, Verne S and Sylvia A on the other side

The most connected pair of women is Evelyn J and Therea A, which means they 

The three most influential people are Evelyn and Theresa together, and then Sylvia A

When expanding the weighted graph, Evelyn is not a boundary spanner though

applying the island method to the Events, we see strongest connection between E8 and E9, and the full island as E3, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9

Graph is bi-partite based on Networkx function

Is connected, Yes, based on Networkx function

Based on degrees, E9 has 12, E8 has 14, E7 has 10
Theresa A has 8, Evelyn J has 8, Nora F has 8
